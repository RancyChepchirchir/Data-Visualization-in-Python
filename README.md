# Data-Visualization-in-Python

The materials are from a very unique course offered by Laxmi Kant on Udemy on Visualization in Python. I learnt EDA on Kaggle's Boston Housing, Titanic, Latest Covid-19 Datasets, Text Dataset, IPL Cricket Matches of all seasons, and FIFA world cup matches with real and practical examples. The course was super insightful hence this share.
